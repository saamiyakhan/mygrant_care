        <summary>1. What kind of medical insurance should my employer provide me?</summary>
            <ul>
            <li> Your employer provides you with medical insurance for injuries that are both work and non-work related. Refer to question 2 for the details</li>
            </ul>

        <summary>2. How much of my medical bills does the insurance cover?</summary>
            <ul>
            <li> <h3>For non-workplace injuries</h3>
            Your employer must buy a medical insurance plan that covers at least S$60,000 per year. This insurance pays for inpatient care, including hospital stays, day surgeries, and other major treatments not related to work injuries.
            Outpatient visits are not covered under this insurance. For free or subsidised outpatient care, check out this section on Primary Care Plans.
            The coverage typically works like this:
                <ul>
                    <li>The insurance pays 100% of the first S$15,000 in hospital bills per year.</li>


                    <li>After that, the insurance covers 75% of the next portion, and your employer pays the remaining 25%, up to the total limit of S$60,000 per year.</li>


                    <li>You do not need to pay anything up to this S$60,000 limit.</li>
                </ul>

                If your bills go beyond S$60,000, your employer is not legally required to cover the extra costs. For such cases, go to the section <a href="..\ecosystem of support\eco.html#F">"Financial aid"</a> for help from community groups.

                <h3>For workplace injuries</h3>
                You are protected under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA). WICA ensures:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Medical expenses are covered up to S$45,000, or for up to one year from the date of the accident (whichever comes first).</li>
                        <li>You are still paid wages while on medical leave due to a work injury:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>100% of your salary for the first 60 days.</li>
                                <li>66.7% (two-thirds) of your salary after 60 days, up to a year.</li>
                            </ul>
                    It is good to understand <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/workplace-safety-and-health/work-injury-compensation/types-of-compensation">WICA</a>, as it also provides important information about reimbursing your family in extreme cases of death at your workplace. In such cases of death, your family should be compensated at least $76,000.

            <details>
        <summary>3. Does the insurance cover all types of illness and treatments?</summary>
            <ul>
            <li> It should cover hospital stays, day surgeries, and any other major treatments. The insurance must follow a standard set of rules. Insurers cannot leave out (exclude) treatments unless it is on an official exclusion list. This means workers can trust that key treatments, like for injuries, serious illness, or surgeries will be covered. 

Take note that outpatient visits are not covered under this insurance, but there are free and subsidised services available for you. Check out <a href='..\ecosystem of support\eco.html'>Medical/ Dental Services.</a>

For more details speak to your employer, or consult professionals mentioned here at <a href='..\ecosystem of support\eco.html'>Legal Advice.</a></li>

        <summary>4. Do I need to pay hospital bills upfront if I get admitted?</summary>
            <ul>
            <li>  No. Once your treatment is approved, the insurance company pays the hospital directly. You don’t have to pay first or wait for reimbursement. This system helps protect workers from sudden medical costs.</li>
            </ul>

        <summary>5. What if my employer refuses to buy or renew the insurance?</summary>
            <ul>
            <li>  That’s against the law. It is mandatory for all employers to buy and maintain medical insurance for migrant workers. If you think you are not covered, you should speak with an NGO or report the issue to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). Click <a href='..\ecosystem of support\eco.html'>here.</a></li>

            <details>
        <summary>6. Will I still be covered if I’m not working due to illness or injury?</summary>
            <ul>
            <li> Yes. The insurance is tied to your valid work pass, not your work activity. Even if you’re recovering or not actively working, as long as your pass is valid, you remain covered under the policy for health issues that involve inpatient care. For any outpatient care, refer to the resources linked <a href='..\ecosystem of support\eco.html'>here</a> for free or subsidised doctor consultations.</li>

        <summary>7. How do I check what insurance I have and what it includes?</summary>
            <ul>
            <li> You can ask your employer for the insurance policy details. It should include the name of the insurer, the start/end dates, what is covered, and what is not. If you need help understanding the document, you can speak with NGOs like HealthServe, TWC2, or FAST for support in your language.<a href='..\ecosystem of support\eco.html'>Here</a> are some organisations you can contact.</li>

        <summary>8. What happens if my treatment costs more than S$60,000 for non workplace injuries and more than $45,000 for workplace injuries?</summary>
            <ul>
            <li>Since the insurance only provides up to $60,000 for non-workplace injuries and $45,000 for workplace injuries, If your medical bills go beyond this, your employer is not legally required to pay more. However, many NGOs and community groups offer support funds, like CritiCare, for exceptional cases. It's important to seek help early in serious medical cases. Check out such groups <a href='..\ecosystem of support\eco.html'>here.</a></li>
