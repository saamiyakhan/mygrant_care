        <summary>1. What do I do if I just got injured and am unable to work for a while?</summary>
            <ul>
            <li>Contact your employer/ manager immediately and inform them. Seek medical assistance! Do not be afraid of doing so, as you will be covered by medical insurance.
                If you got injured/sick in your workplace, under Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA), you will be insured for up to $45,000 for all your medical expenses, including in-patient and out-patient care. for up to $60,000 for inpatient medical care, where you are hospitalized. For how much leave you are allowed, it is trickier but typically you should have no issues getting leave for up to 60 days. However, check with your employer or some legal advisors linked here.</li>

        <summary>4. What if I have a terminal illness or very high bills exceeding my insurance coverage?</summary>
            <ul>
            <li>Insurance is not enough to cover your bills, terminal illnesses like late-stage cancer easily surpass the limit, and chemotherapy is outpatient care and usually not covered under insurance. When faced with such situations, talk to your employer, legal advisors linked in Legal Enquiries, and please reach out for support for your mental health linked in Mental Health.

            After speaking to your employers and legal advisors, you may have a better idea of your next steps. They might have shared with you non-profit organisations that raise funds for migrant workers. Some organisations you can approach are:
            <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.criticarefundformigrantworkers.org/">Criticare Fund for Migrant Workers</a>, who specifically raise funds for the healthcare of migrant workers with terminal illnesses. This is the most suitable organisation for such cases.</li>
            <li><a href="https://itsrainingraincoats.com/">ItsRainingRaincoats</a>, an organisation built to help migrant workers, that might help you raise money too.</li>
            </ul>
            Do be aware and inform your family of the compensation in cases of death. To get info about this, contact the <a href="../ecosystem of support/eco.html">legal advisors</a>.
